🎮 Just finished building a super fun "Catch the Ball" game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
🏀 Players can control a basket to catch falling balls, making it both exciting and challenging. 
This project was a great way to polish my front-end development skills and implement game logic. Check it out!
